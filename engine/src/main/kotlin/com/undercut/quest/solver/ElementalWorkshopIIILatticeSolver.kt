/**
 * Step-following solver for the Elemental Workshop III lattice puzzle (interface [PUZZLE]).
 *
 * The puzzle is deterministic — identical after every Reset — so this replays the quest's known
 * per-phase lever sequences as highlights. It reads only state that is position-free and survives the
 * constant instance re-entry (no tile coordinates anywhere):
 *
 *  - **Which group we're in** (right / left / tower) is derived from two game-states and tracked as a
 *    running max so it can't regress: the right counter ([RIGHT_COUNTER]) latches at [COUNTER_TARGET]
 *    once sections 1–2 finish (→ group 1, phase 3), and the "Moves left" counter jumps past its normal
 *    100 cap to [MOVES_UNLIMITED] when section 4 grants unlimited moves (→ group 2, the tower, phase
 *    5). The left/tower counters do NOT cleanly hit 50, so they're not used. This seeds the starting
 *    phase (resume mid-puzzle) and drives every group change.
 *  - **Step within a phase** comes from the "Moves left" counter (comp [MOVES_COMPONENT]): every real
 *    move drops it by exactly one in *all* phases — in the tower it just counts down from the 101 the
 *    grant put it at (it is not frozen). An Undo bumps it one; a Reset refund / the +50 grant jump it
 *    up by more, which never advances the step.
 *
 * Why this is robust where counting moves alone wasn't: group boundaries key off reaching those
 * states (right counter latched, move counter past 100), tracked monotonically — so the +50 grant
 * after section 2 and the unlimited-moves jump after section 4 can't be mistaken for, or skip, a
 * section. Within a group the first phase advances on the Reset after its finished sequence.
 *
 * Highlight-only. All state is touched only from the main-logic thread ([evaluate]).
