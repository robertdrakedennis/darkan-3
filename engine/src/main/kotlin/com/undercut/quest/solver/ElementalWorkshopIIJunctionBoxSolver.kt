/**
 * Solver for the junction-box pipe puzzle in *Elemental Workshop II* (step 25 —
 * "connect the pipes by clicking on a pair of pipe holes").
 *
 * Interface [JUNCTION_BOX] has six pipe holes; the solution is three fixed pairs,
 * each connected by clicking both holes:
 *   - top-left ([TL]=24)    + bottom-right ([BR]=23)
 *   - top-middle ([TM]=25)  + top-right ([TR]=20)
 *   - bottom-left ([BL]=21) + bottom-middle ([BM]=22)
 *
 * Per-hole selection state lives in client vars (CS2 scripts 1318/1319 toggle
 * `varclient_162..167`): 1 = that hole is currently selected/lit, 0 = not. A
 * connection is two clicks — select a hole, then click its partner.
 *
 * The solver highlights the next button to press and self-corrects: when a hole is
 * selected it points at that hole's fixed partner (so any mis-selection is recovered
 * by completing or re-clicking it); when nothing is selected it lights the first hole
 * of all three pairs so the player can start any of them.
 *
 * NOTE: the connection/progress varbits (player 13703/13704) proved unreliable on a
 * fresh puzzle (varp 2746 decodes 13704=3 with nothing connected), so this relies on
 * the client-var selection state plus the fixed solution rather than a progress count.
