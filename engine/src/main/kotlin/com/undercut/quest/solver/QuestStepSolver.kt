/**
 * Programmatic driver for a single quest step whose correct highlight/advance
 * logic depends on dynamic game state — slide puzzles, dynamic orb positions,
 * combination locks, mazes, etc. Static JSON `actions` and `postconditions`
 * can't describe those because the right answer changes per attempt.
 *
 * A step references a solver via [QuestStep.solverId]; the solver runs each
 * tick while that step is active. It can:
 *  - Return [overlayActions] — extra [QuestAction]s rendered alongside the
 *    step's static actions (typically [QuestAction.ModelHighlight] /
 *    [QuestAction.ConversationHighlight] / [QuestAction.InventoryHighlight]
 *    pointing at the *currently-correct* target).
 *  - Return [solved] — when true, the helper auto-advances to the next step
 *    (combined with any static postconditions via AND).
 *
 * Solvers should be pure functions of game state — keep no side effects across
 * ticks beyond inert caching. They run on the client tick thread.
