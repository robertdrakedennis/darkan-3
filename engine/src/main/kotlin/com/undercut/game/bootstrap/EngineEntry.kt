 * The engine's implementation of the supervisor's [EngineHandle] — the single class the disposable

 * it down so this classloader can be dropped and a rebuilt jar loaded fresh.
 *
 * [EngineHandle] is resolved from the shared parent loader (it is excluded from the engine shadow
 * jar), so this cross-loader implements + cast works.
