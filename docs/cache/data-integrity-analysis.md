### Archive Indices (255/N)

All 45 archive reference tables (stored in `js5-255.jcache`) also validated successfully. Headers are consistent, compression types valid (BZIP2, GZIP, LZMA used across indices), and all decompress without error.

### Priority Archives (28, 59, 62)

These are the first archives the NXT client requests after receiving the master index:

- **Index 28** (quickchat): 11 groups, mix of uncompressed (comp=0) and GZIP (comp=2). All OK.
- **Index 59**: 5 groups, GZIP and BZIP2. Largest is 213,911 bytes. All OK.
- **Index 62**: 7 groups, all BZIP2 compressed. All OK.

## Version Suffix Analysis

**Finding: The cache downloader does NOT store a 2-byte version suffix.**

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Containers with 0 extra bytes | 539,779 |
| Containers with 2 extra bytes (version suffix) | 0 |
| Containers with other extra bytes | 0 |

### Data Flow Details

The version suffix question is critical for understanding CRC behavior. Here is the complete data flow:

#### 1. Wire Format (Jagex JS5 Response)

The NXT JS5 protocol sends:
```
[index(1)][hash(4)][compression(1)][compressedSize(4BE)]  -- 10-byte response header
[payload: decompSize(4, if compressed) + compressed_data]
```
This is framed in 102,400-byte blocks with 5-byte continuation headers.

In old RS2/OSRS, the wire format appended a 2-byte version suffix AFTER the container payload. The NXT protocol does NOT include this suffix on the wire.

#### 2. Cache Downloader Storage

The downloader (`JS5Connection.receiver()` and `JS5Protocol.readResponse()`) reconstructs the container as:
```
container = [compression(1)][compressedSize(4BE)][payload]
```
Where payload = `decompressedSize(4, if compressed) + compressed_data`.

The container is stored in SQLite via `IndexFile.putRaw()` exactly as reconstructed -- no version suffix added.

#### 3. Server FileProvider

`FileProvider.data(index, archive)` returns the raw SQLite blob via `cache.sector()` -> `IndexFile.getRaw()`.

`FileProvider.serve()` builds the JS5 response by:
- Extracting compression and compressedSize from the first 5 bytes of stored data
- Writing a 10-byte response header (index + hash + compression + compressedSize)
- Copying the payload (bytes 5+) from stored data
- NO version suffix is appended

#### 4. CRC Computation

- **Master index CRCs** (for archive indices): Computed by `VersionTableBuilder.sector()` over the ENTIRE raw ref table blob (`IndexFile.getRawTable()`). This matches what `sector(255, indexId)` returns.
- **Ref table CRCs** (for group data): Stored in the decompressed ref table. These are the CRCs Jagex computed, presumably over `container_data - 2_bytes` in older protocols. Since NXT does not include a version suffix, and our downloader stores no suffix, `CRC.calculate(stored_data)` matches the ref table CRC directly.

### Conclusion on Version Suffix

The NXT JS5 protocol (rev 946) does not use a 2-byte version suffix. The CRC stored in the archive ref table is computed over the full container (header + payload), which is exactly what we store. This is confirmed by the 100% CRC match rate across all 539,779 containers.

## Implications for Serving

Since all containers are valid and CRC-consistent:
1. The `FileProvider` can serve stored data as-is without modification
2. No version suffix stripping or addition is needed
3. The master index CRCs (computed at server startup by `VersionTableBuilder`) will match what the client computes when it downloads archive indices
4. Group CRCs from the ref table will match what the client computes when it downloads individual groups

## Tool Usage

```bash
./gradlew :tools:run -PmainClass=org.darkan.tools.CacheIntegrityCheckKt
```

Runtime: ~12 minutes (processes 539K containers across 46 SQLite databases).
