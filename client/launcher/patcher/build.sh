#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Build libdarkan_patcher.so and deploy it to EVERY location the launcher's
# find_patcher_library (client/launcher/src/game/process.rs) can resolve to.
#
# Why this script exists:
#   The launcher loads the patcher .so from the first of several candidate
#   locations that exists (next to the launcher exe, next to the client binary,
#   ~/darkan-3/, the dev build dir). If ANY of those holds a stale copy, it
#   shadows a fresh build. A stale March-23 build (still searching for the old
#   947 login-key prefix 8f389edb) once sat in ~/.local/share/bolt-rs3/ and was
#   loaded over a current build, so the client was never patched. This script
#   makes "build the patcher" atomically refresh every deploy slot so stale
#   copies can never win again.
#
# Usage:  client/launcher/patcher/build.sh
#         (run from anywhere; all paths are derived, no cwd assumptions)
#
# All destination paths are $HOME-relative — no hardcoded /home/<user> paths.

# The compiled .so does NOT store these 32-char hex prefixes as one contiguous
# ASCII run: rustc lowers the byte-string literals into inline x86 immediates,
# splitting them into 8-byte chunks interleaved with instruction bytes. So a
# grep for the full 32-char literal returns 0 even on a perfectly current build.
# What IS reliably contiguous (it lands in a single immediate) is the FIRST
# 8 hex chars of each prefix. We therefore verify with the 8-char markers:
#   - CURRENT (948) build must contain CURRENT_MARK and must NOT contain OLD_MARK
#   - the full 32-char literal is checked against the SOURCE instead, which is
#     the authoritative statement of what we are building.
